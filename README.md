# How Old?

A small script, that helps you calculate the age of an artist back while they released something.

If you ever wondered how old was 50 Cent while releasing In da Club, this script is for you!
Highly inspired by the [Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdsUKphmB3Y). Results for all the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show searches are at the end of the readme.

## Usage

###### how_old.sh

To set the **age of the artist** you can both use the **current age** of the **birth year**.

**`how_old.sh [ Birth year of the artist | Age of the artist ] [ Release year ]`**

Answer for my original question with 50 Cent and In da Club

**`how_old.sh 1975 2003`**

###### super_bowl.sh
